Name: Helen Zhang (hzhan308)Module 1 Assignment: Personal Website Due on 1/25/2026 at 11:59 ESTApproach: Pages Directory__init__.py – The goal of this program is to import the pages blueprint for the Flask application.  This allows all the routes created in the pages.py to be grouped together and then used within the Flask program.pages.py – The goal of this program is to specify the routes for the website using both flask and blueprint. Each of the routes are linked to a specific page of the website, so the homepage, contact, and projects. The blueprint groups all these website page routes into one place and improves the functionality of the application.Static DirectoryHZ.jpg – The goal of this photo is to have and store the static jpg that will be used as the image in the homepage.html of the website.Templates Directorycontact.html – The goal of this html file is to create and define the contact information page for the website. The page starts by setting the specifications to create a fixed navigation bar at the top of the screen so that the user can go from the homepage, contact page, and projects pages. It also will highlight the contact tab to show that it is the page that the user is currently on. The navigation bar uses CSS to ensure the bar is the same Carolina blue color and all the links are on the top right-hand corner of the screen. The page and body itself contain the title “Contact Information” as the h1. Then it goes into the details about the contact information, including specifics and clickable links to the email address and LinkedIn.homepage.html – The goal of this html file is to define what the homepage or landing page of the website will be. The navigation bar is setup similarly to the contact.html except that the homepage will be highlighted in this instance. In addition, we add specifics on how we want to place the bio and photo side by side with the bio on the left and the photo on the right.The page and body itself start with setting the title and subtitle with the name and job description for the website (h1 and h2). Then it goes into setting the specifics for the bio and photo. The bio is written out under <div> and then the photo is linked from the static directory.projects.html – The goal of this html file is to define what the projects page of the website looks be. The navigation bar is setup similarly to the contact.html except that the projects will be highlighted in this instance.The page and body start with setting the title as Projects and then sections into the first and only project listed on the site. The title of the project (Module 1: Personal Website) is bolded and then a description is added to give a quick overview of the project. Then we link the GitHub repository for the user to access if they wish.__init__.py – The goal of this program is to setup the run.py program and to initialize the Flask application. We setup the app and then register the pages blueprint so that all those routes are included on the website. run.py – The goal of this program is to import the app and start the server from __init__.py program. We import the flask from __init__.py and only run the specification provided from the assignment directions if the program is executed directly.Known Bugs:There are no known bugsCitations:https://realpython.com/flask-project/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRvO7g9o8eQhttps://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asphttps://codetheweb.blog/style-a-navigation-bar-css/https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_center.ASPhttps://www.w3schools.com/html/html_div.aspLLMs were used to improve and help with the assignment, especially the syntax for the html sites.
